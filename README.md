# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple calender application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.
This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
The styling of the calendar changes depending on the hour of the day. 

## How to Use
1. Point your browser to https://m-car.github.io/WorkDayScheduler/
2. Click into any of the colored boxes to enter a task for that hour. 

  <img src="assets\images\Capture.PNG" alt="capture" width ="300"/>

3. Click the save button for that time block. 
4. Saved tasks will persist on page refresh. 

Happy Scheduling!

## Known Bugs
- On page refresh, the last task saved will be displayed on all time blocks. 

## TODO
- Save individual text to unique portions of local storage, possibly through Local Storage Objects
- Display correct saved text per time block on page refresh.
